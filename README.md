# Street Monochrome

Black and white style for the darktable.

This style doesn't emulate any existing film, although you can find some parallels with the JCH StreetPan 400 or with the pushed Kodak Tri-X 400 film stocks.

## Usage

This is a high-contrast monochrome style for the darktable. It's designed to be applied in the **display-referred** workflow after the standard base curve of the camera, so technically it'll work with any camera with the slight differences in the dynamic range.

If you're underexposing your photos and you need to tweak the exposure afterwards - use the `color balance rgb > global brilliance` slider. It'll change the contrast in the relation to the exposure changes, and everything will look more natural. It'll work more like in the push process. The standard exposure slider doesn't work in this way.

The additional LUT file is created to use the same style in the different editing programs or with JPEG files, where we don't need all these RAW-related modules. For obvious reasons it does not include the denoise settings, clarity and sharpening effects, so a little lack of contrast is expected in comparison with the standard style.
